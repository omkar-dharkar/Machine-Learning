# Machine-Learning

**Data Science and Machine Learning Projects (Personal Collection)**(DRAFT)

**Introduction**  
Welcome to my personal project space! This is where I document my ongoing journey into data science and machine learning. You’ll find projects I’ve already worked on and others I’m excited to dive into soon. Each of these represents a milestone in my exploration of new techniques and approaches within the world of data science.

**Active Projects**  
1. **Predicting Bike Demand**  
   *Objective*: The goal of this project is to predict bike-sharing demand by analyzing a mix of factors like weather, temperature, and holidays. It’s all about using machine learning algorithms to make predictions that are as accurate as possible.  
   *Technologies*: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
   *Link to Project*: [Predicting Bike Demand](#)

2. **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**  
   *Objective*: This project focuses on analyzing social media posts to identify how users feel about certain topics. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), I categorize sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral.  
   *Technologies*: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, WordCloud  
   *Link to Project*: [Sentiment Analysis](#)

**Upcoming Projects**  
1. **Predicting House Prices**  
   *Objective*: In this upcoming project, I’ll be working on predicting house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities. The end goal is to create a regression model capable of providing precise price predictions.  
   *Technologies*: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn

2. **Customer Segmentation**  
   *Objective*: This project will explore customer segmentation by clustering individuals based on their buying behaviors. The purpose is to gain insights into different customer groups to refine marketing strategies.  
   *Technologies*: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Closing Thoughts**  
This repository is my evolving portfolio of data science projects. I plan to keep updating it with both new work and refinements of past projects. Feel free to explore, offer feedback, or even collaborate with me. I’d love to hear your thoughts!
